#Simple Linear Regression: Custom Implementation and Scikit-learn Comparison

##Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Simple Linear Regression model using two approaches:

Custom Implementation: A Python class manually calculates mean, variance, covariance, and regression coefficients ( and ) to train and predict.

Scikit-learn: Utilizes the LinearRegression class from the scikit-learn library for an optimized implementation.

The purpose of the project is to provide a hands-on understanding of the mathematical foundations of Linear Regression and to compare it with a standardized library-based approach.

##Features

Custom implementation of regression coefficients calculation.

Prediction functionality using the regression equation .

Evaluation of model performance using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R-squared ()

Visualization of:

Scatter plot of data points.

Regression line for both custom and scikit-learn implementations.

Files

linear_regression.py: Main script containing both the custom implementation and the scikit-learn version of Linear Regression.

Sample Data: Hardcoded feature (X) and target (Y) values used for testing the model.

Plots: Generated scatter plots and regression lines.
